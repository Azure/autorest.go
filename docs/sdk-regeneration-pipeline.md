# SDK Regeneration Pipeline Guideline

This document provides a guideline about the SDK regeneration pipeline for TypeSpec Go emitter developers.

## Pipeline Overview

> **Pipeline Link**: [SDK Regeneration Pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=7860)

The SDK regeneration pipeline regenerates Azure Go SDK by using feature branch or main branch of TypeSpec Go emitter with the same API version as the released SDK (which to make sure SDK changes are due to TypeSpec or Go emitter release, not API version). This pipeline validates emitter changes and ensures that SDK packages stay up-to-date with TypeSpec changes and emitter changes.

### Limitations

⚠️ **Management Plane Only**: This pipeline is currently designed exclusively for management plane (resource manager) SDKs. It does **not** support:
- Data plane SDKs
- Client libraries outside the `sdk/resourcemanager` directory
- Custom SDK implementations
- SDK generated by Swagger

### Pipeline Process
The SDK regeneration pipeline automates the process of updating Azure SDK packages with the latest TypeSpec Go emitter changes. Here are the key stages:
> 💡For detailed implementation, see the complete pipeline definition in [`/eng/pipelines/sdk-regenerate.yml`](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.go/blob/main/eng/pipelines/sdk-regenerate.yml) and the regeneration script in [`/eng/scripts/sdk_regenerate.py`](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.go/blob/main/eng/scripts/sdk_regenerate.py)

#### 1. Setup & Build
- Sets up environment (Node.js, Go, pnpm, tsp-client)
- Builds the current TypeSpec Go emitter from current branch
- Updates emitter configuration in Azure Go SDK based on package mode (dev vs released)

#### 2. Package Discovery
- Scans `sdk/resourcemanager` for packages with `tsp-location.yaml`
- Applies service filtering (if specified)
- Extracts **original API versions** from existing packages (`_metadata.json` or client files)

#### 3. SDK Generation
- Runs `tsp-client update` for each package with original API version
- Tracks success/failure for each package

#### 4. Results & PR Creation
- Generates results report (`regenerate-sdk-result.json`)
- Creates draft PR in azure-sdk-for-go with all changes, PR title: `[Automation] Regenerate SDK based on typespec-go branch {branch-name}`

### Pipeline Parameters

#### Required Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `UseLatestSpec` | boolean | `false` | Whether to use the latest API specifications from [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) or the original commit of `tsp-location.yml` |
| `ServiceFilter` | string | `.*` | Regex pattern to filter which services to regenerate. Matches against the service package name (e.g., `armcompute`, `armstorage`) |
| `UseDevPackage` | boolean | `false` | Whether to use dev package (.tgz) from current branch or the released package from npm registry |

#### Usage Examples

##### Generate All SDKs with Latest Specs (Default)
```yaml
UseLatestSpec: true
ServiceFilter: '.*'
UseDevPackage: false
```

##### Generate All SDKs with Dev Package
```yaml
UseLatestSpec: false
ServiceFilter: '.*'
UseDevPackage: true
```

##### Generate Specific Services with Dev Package
```yaml
UseLatestSpec: false
ServiceFilter: 'armcompute|armstorage|armchaos'
UseDevPackage: true
```

##### Generate One Service with Released Package
```yaml
UseLatestSpec: true
ServiceFilter: 'armcompute'
UseDevPackage: false
```

### Package Modes

The pipeline supports two package modes controlled by the `UseDevPackage` parameter:

#### Dev Package Mode (`UseDevPackage: true`)
- Uses the locally built TypeSpec Go emitter package (.tgz) from the current branch
- Calls `New-EmitterPackageJson.ps1` PowerShell script to generate `emitter-package.json` 
- Updates the package path to point to the local .tgz file
- Ideal for testing unreleased emitter changes during development

#### Released Package Mode (`UseDevPackage: false`) 
- Uses the published TypeSpec Go emitter package from npm registry
- Calls `tsp-client generate-config-files` to generate emitter configuration
- Uses the version specified in `package.json`
- Ideal for validating released versions and regular SDK refresh

## Pipeline Usage

### Weekly Trigger
This pipeline has been scheduled to run at 2 AM UTC on Monday weekly

### Manually Trigger
1. Navigate to the [pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=7860)
2. Select which branch of emitter you want to validate
3. Configure parameters:
   - Set `UseLatestSpec` to `true` for latest API specs, `false` for the original commit of `tsp-location.yml`
   - Set `ServiceFilter` for specific services (use `.*` for all)
   - Set `UseDevPackage` to `true` for dev package mode, `false` for released package mode
4. Click "Run"

### PR Structure
- **Title**: `[Automation] Regenerate SDK based on typespec-go branch {branch-name}`
- **Status**: Opens as draft PR for review
- **Base Branch**: `main` branch of azure-sdk-for-go
- **Branch Name**: `typespec-go-regenerate-{branch-name}`

### PR Contents
- Updated SDK packages with latest TypeSpec Go emitter and original spec api version
- Regeneration result: regenerate-sdk-result.json
```json
{
  "succeed_to_regenerate": ["package1", "package2"],
  "fail_to_regenerate": ["package3"],
  "not_found_api_version": ["package4"],
  "time_to_regenerate": "2025-09-25 10:30:45.123456",
  "typespec_go_commit_hash": "abc123def456789..."
}
```

## Validate and Refresh SDK

### Development Workflow

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[TypeSpec Go Emitter Changes] --> B[Trigger Regeneration Pipeline]
    B --> C[Review Generated SDK PR]
    C --> D[Merge Emitter PR]
    D --> E[Close Generated SDK PR]
    
    K[TypeSpec/Emitter Version Released] --> L[Trigger Regeneration Pipeline]
    L --> M[Review Generated SDK PR]
    M --> N[Merge Generated SDK PR]
```

#### For Development Validation
1. **Develop & Test**: Complete TypeSpec Go emitter development and testing on feature branch
2. **Trigger Pipeline**: Trigger regeneration pipeline for your feature branch with `UseDevPackage: true`
3. **Review Changes**: Review the generated PR to ensure all changes are due to TypeSpec or Go emitter release
4. **Merge Emitter**: Merge TypeSpec Go emitter PR into main branch
5. **Close Regeneration PR**: Close/abandon the regeneration PR (it was only for validation)

#### For Regular SDK Refresh
After each TypeSpec or Go emitter version release:
1. **Trigger Pipeline**: Trigger regeneration pipeline for `main` branch with `UseDevPackage: false` 
2. **Review Changes**: Review the generated PR to ensure all changes are due to TypeSpec or Go emitter release
3. **Merge Regeneration PR**: Merge the refresh PR to keep SDK up-to-date

### Quality Gates
- All pipelines must be pass
- All SDK code changes are made by either TypeSpec changes or Go emitter changes
- Module versions must not be changed
- API versions must not be changed
